# PHPUnit Configuration

Personal PHPUnit default config file. 
Simple straight-forward and minimal, but prevents me having to copy it around or lookup/remember the exact xml specs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* php `^7.4||^8.0||^8.1`
* Composer `2`
* zsh

### Installation

```shell
composer global require jascha030/phpunit-config
```

## Usage

Installing this package globally will make the `puconf` shell command available.
This command will copy the `phpunit.xml` config file to your current working directory.
